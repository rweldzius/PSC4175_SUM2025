# Agenda

1. Uncertainty

2. More NBA data

3. \#TrustTheProcess

4. Conditional Means

# Sports Analytics

- Previously, we looked at players

--

  - Specifically, `isRookie` and `tov`
  
  - But could try **many** other ideas
  
--

- Useful if we want a job scouting talent

- But what if we want to advise actual games?

--

  - **Game Data**!

---

# Other NBA Data

--

- Load the `game_summary.Rds` data

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
gms <- read_rds('../data/game_summary.Rds')
gms
```

---

# Other NBA Data

- Contains data on every game played between 2016 and 2019

--

```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
gms %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dateGame)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'count')
```

---

# Other NBA Data

- Contains data on every game played between 2016 and 2019

```{r, fig.keep='none'}
gms %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dateGame)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'count')
```

- *Pause*: What happens when you keep `geom_bar()` blank? What about `geom_bar(stat = 'identity)`?

# Other NBA Data

```{r}
glimpse(gms)
```

# Codebook

--

- Which of these are categorical? Which are continuous?

--

  - Remember the **process**!
  
--

- `isWin` as an ordered binary

```{r}
gms %>%
  count(isWin)
```

---

# Codebook

- The same number for wins and losses?
  
```{r}
gms %>%
  select(idGame,nameTeam,dateGame,locationGame,isWin) %>% head()
```

--

- Each row is a **team-game** pair

--

  - i.e., the Cavs hosted the Knicks on October 25, 2016 and won!
  
---

# The Knicks

# .blue[Science]

--

- What predicts winning?

--

  - Points? (more is better)
  - Turnovers? (less is better)
  - Rebounds? (more is better)
  
--

- How confident are we?

```{r}
gms %>%
  group_by(isWin) %>%
  summarise(avgTO = mean(tov))
```

---

# Turnovers and Winning

--

- On average, winning teams have ~1 fewer turnover than losing teams

--

- FSNoR: is this *always* the case?

```{r}
gms %>%
  filter(yearSeason == 2017) %>%
  group_by(isWin) %>%
  summarise(avgTO = mean(tov))
```

---

# Turnovers and Winning

- On average, winning teams have ~1 fewer turnover than losing teams

- FSNoR: is this *always* the case?

```{r}
gms %>%
  filter(yearSeason == 2018) %>%
  group_by(isWin) %>%
  summarise(avgTO = mean(tov))
```

---

# Turnovers and Winning

- On average, winning teams have ~1 fewer turnover than losing teams

- FSNoR: is this *always* the case?

```{r}
gms %>%
  group_by(isWin,yearSeason) %>%
  summarise(avgTO = mean(tov)) %>%
  spread(isWin,avgTO,sep = '_')
```


---

# Turnovers and Winning

- On average, winning teams have ~1 fewer turnover than losing teams

- FSNoR: is this *always* the case?

--

  - Not literally (numbers change)

--

  - But practically?
  
- How **confident** are we in making this claim?

--

  - In each season, the average turnovers of winning teams are roughly 1 lower than the average turnovers of losing teams
  
--

  - Use **bootstrap sampling** to express this more concretely!
