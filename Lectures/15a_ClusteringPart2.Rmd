# Social Media

- Unprecedented access to our leaders

  - (If they let us)

# Social Media

- For researchers, social media is two things

--

  1. A source of .red[data]
  
--

  2. An object of .blue[interest]

# Twitter as Data

- Not the most popular social media app

# Twitter as Data

- But an outsized platform for the elite

--

- As of 2020

--

  - every U.S. governor had a Twitter account
  
--

  - 49 had a Facebook account
  
--

  - 44 had an Instagram account

--

  - 44 had a YouTube account
  
--

- In professional networks, particularly media, Twitter is almost *lingua franca*

# Twitter as Data

- Today?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.<br><br>Extremely messed up!

# Trump and Twitter

- Today, looking at Trump's tweets

--

  - Treating it as a .red[data source]
  
--

  - What can his tweets tell us about the man?
  
```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
tweets <- read_rds(file="../Data/Trumptweets.Rds")
```

--

- The **process**

--

  - Univariate visualisation: how often does he tweet?
  
--

```{r}
p <- tweets %>% 
  count(Tweeting.date) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=Tweeting.date,y=n),alpha=.4) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = 'years',date_labels = '%Y') + 
  labs(x="Date",y="Number of Tweets",title="Tweeting by Trump")
```

---

# Trump and Twitter

```{r}
p
```

---

# Trump and Twitter

- Research questions abound!

--

1. What happened in...
  
  - June of 2011?
    
  - June of 2012?
    
  - November of 2016? (duh)
    
--

2. Overtime increase during presidency?

--

3. Others?

---

# Trump and Twitter

- .blue[Research Question:] Did Trump's twitter account benefit from his presidency?

--

```{r,message = F}
require(scales)
p <- tweets %>% 
  group_by(Tweeting.date) %>%
  summarize(AvgRetweet = mean(retweets)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=Tweeting.date,y=AvgRetweet),alpha=.4) +
  labs(x="Date",y="Average Retweets",title="Tweeting by Trump") +
  scale_y_continuous(label=comma)
```

---

# Trump and Twitter

- .blue[Research Question:] Did Trump's twitter account benefit from his presidency?

- **Yes**

```{r,echo = F}
p
```


---

# Looking with `plotly`

```{r message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
gg <- tweets %>%
  filter(retweets > quantile(retweets,.75)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Tweeting.date,y=retweets,text=stringr::str_wrap(content,width = 60))) +
  geom_point(alpha=.4) +
  labs(x="Date",y="Retweets",title="Tweeting by Trump") +
  scale_y_continuous(label=scales::comma)
```

---

# Looking with `plotly`

```{r}
ggplotly(gg,tooltip = "text")
```

---

# Trump's Censored Tweets

- What was Trump tweeting about when he was flagged by Twitter?

```{r}
tweets %>%
  filter(is_flagged) %>% # Indicator for Twitter flag
  ggplot(aes(x = Tweeting.date)) + geom_bar()
```

# Trump's Censored Tweets

- Proportion of flagged tweets instead of counts

```{r,echo=F,warning=F,message=F}
gg <- tweets %>%
  count(Tweeting.date,is_flagged) %>%
  group_by(Tweeting.date) %>%
  mutate(totTweets = sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(prop = n / totTweets) %>%
  filter(is_flagged) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Tweeting.date,y = prop)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  labs(x = 'Date',y = 'Proportion of Total Tweets Flagged')
```

```{r}
gg
```

---

# Looking at content

- We could just look at the flagged tweets themselves

```{r,echo=F}
gg <- tweets %>%
  filter(is_flagged) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Tweeting.date,y = retweets,text = stringr::str_wrap(content,width = 60))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  labs(x = 'Date',y = 'Total Retweets')
```

```{r}
ggplotly(gg)
```

---

# Looking at content

- Or we can look at statistical summaries of Trump's tweets

--

  1. Tweets as .red[data]: we can understand him better
  
  2. Tweets as .blue[object of interest]: how do his tweets influence public discourse?
  
--

- We will be using pre-processed tweets

--

  - Lots of **data wrangling** went into this
  
  - See the `prepping_raw_tweets.R` file for more details

--

- Next time:

```{r}
tweet_words <- read_rds(file="../Data/Trump_tweet_words.Rds")
```
