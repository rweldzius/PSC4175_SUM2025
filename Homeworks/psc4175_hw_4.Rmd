# Learning Objectives

- Visualizing data in `ggplot`

- Functions: `ggplot`, 

- Applications: College data; NBA player data (sorry, Knicks)

## Agenda

Visualization is one of `R`'s most impressive features, and arguably where it surpasses other competing programs like Python. Visualization can either be done in "base" `R`, or via a powerful set of functions included in the `ggplot` package. In this class, we will be working exclusively in `ggplot`, which is included in the `tidyverse` package. 

Let's start by loading our college data again.

## Load relevant libraries
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load The Data
Once `tidyverse` is loaded, you can download the data directly from  [GitHub](https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC4175_SUM2025/raw/main/Data/sc_debt.Rds) using the `read_rds()` function. You should then open it in `R` by assigning it to an object with the `<-` command.

```{r}
df<-read_rds("https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC4175_SUM2025/raw/main/Data/sc_debt.Rds") 
names(df)
```


## `ggplot`

`ggplot` works in layers, where the most simple layer is contained in the `ggplot()` function itself. Here, you set the x and y axes with a function called `aes()` (for the plot "aesthetics"). The primary inputs to `aes()` are `x` and `y`, although you can also set things like `color` and `fill` here.

Let's create the first layer of our plot by using the `%>%` function to link our data with the `ggplot()` function.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg))
```

This gives us a rather ugly looking graph box (see the bottom right quadrant of RStudio), where we see the admissions rate on the x-axis (the horizontal axis) and the SAT scores on the y-axis (the vertical axis). However, there are no visuals like lines or bars or points to help us actually SEE the data. We know that ggplot has them on the axes we specified, but we haven't drawn anything yet.

The next step is to add a "layer" to this plot that contains the visuals we want. To add a layer, we use the `+` sign to link our blank canvas to the function to draw the graph. In this situation, we are going to create a scatterplot using the function named `geom_point()`. (There are **many** other functions that are included with ggplot which will draw different plots...`geom_line()` and `geom_bar()` for example.)

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) + 
  geom_point()
```

# Tweaking Visuals

We have a visualization of our data! It suggests that there is a negative relationship between the admissions rate and SAT scores. When the admissions rate is very low (i.e., when schools are very selective), the average SAT scores of their students is above 1500 (top left part of the graph). When the admissions rate is very high, the average SAT scores is around 1000 (bottom right of the graph). Why might this be?

We can easily see this pattern just by looking at the data. However, we can make it even more clear by overlaying a "line of best fit" using a different function called `geom_smooth()`. This is going to be our **second** layer, meaning we need another `+` sign to link the function.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

The default behavior of `geom_smooth()` is to draw a slightly curvy line that bends. This is potentially useful, since it reveals that the negative relationship between the admissions rate and the SAT scores is stronger among more selective schools (i.e., those with an admissions rate less than 0.50 or 50%), but almost flat among less selective schools.

However, if all we want is the **overall** relationship drawn with a straight line, we need to tell `geom_smooth()` to draw a straight line with the input `method = "lm"`. ("lm" stands for "linear model", a topic we will come back to later in the semester.)

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

# Colors
We can continue to tweak this plot by changing the colors of the points. For example, we could color EVERY point red as follows

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) + 
  geom_point(color = 'red')
```

However, we could instead color points *based on their value*. To do so, we want to move the `color` input **inside** the `aes()` function, and set it equal to the variable we want to visualize with color.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg,
             color = region)) + 
  geom_point()
```

We now have a legend added to the plot that tells us what each color refers to. In this example, we set the color equal to a categorical variable. We could instead set it equal to a continuous variable, which would give us a gradient.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg,
             color = md_earn_wne_p6)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Here we see two patterns. First, we continue to see the negative relationship between the admissions rate and the SAT scores. Second, we can *kinda* see a relationship between future wages of graduates and their SAT scores. 

If we don't like the default choice of dark to light blue, we can modify this with `scale_color_gradient()`. As always, add another `+` to add the layer to the plot!

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg,
             color = md_earn_wne_p6)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_gradient(low = 'grey90',high = 'darkred')
```

Note that some of the points are dark gray. These are schools that don't report the median earnings of their recent graduates. These missing data default to a dark gray color. You can find more colors in the R color palette here: https://r-graph-gallery.com/color-palette-finder. 

**Quick Exercise** Re-do this plot but put `md_earn_wne_p6` on the y-axis, and `sat_avg` on the x-axis. Is there a relationship between SAT scores and earnings? Why might this be the case?

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```

Write your answer to the questions here.

## Other Aesthetics
We can also change the size of the points with the `size` input. As with `color`, this can either be set uniformly for all points, or we can make the size a function of another variable.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  labs(title = 'Uniform Size Setting for all points')
```


```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg,
             size = md_earn_wne_p6)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = 'Sized by the future earnings')
```

# Transparency

With so many points overlapping, especially with larger points, it becomes harder for the reader to see details. We can therefore adjust the transparency of these points with the `alpha` parameter, which can be a value between 0 and 1. Values closer to zero make the points more transparent, while values closer to 1 make them more opaque.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = adm_rate,y = sat_avg,
             size = md_earn_wne_p6)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + 
  labs(title = 'Sized by the future earnings')
```

# Other Types of Plots

This topic is very **deep** and you can spend years becoming an `R` expert and still find new ways of visualizing things. I encourage you to keep this link bookmarked: http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html. 

For now though, a few other types of plots:

## Histograms & Densities

For visualization of a **single measure** (what we often call a univariate plot), a histogram is often useful. Here, we only need to set the x-axis variable. The `geom_histogram()` function will calculate the y-axis values for us, which is the number of schools falling into each bin. If we add all the bins together, we get the total number of schools in the data.


```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(md_earn_wne_p6)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

We can also get the same result with a density plot, which replaces the histogram with a line. The y-axis becomes the fraction of schools at each point on the x-axis, and adds up to 1.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = md_earn_wne_p6)) + 
  geom_density()
```

## Barplots

Barplots are another common type of data visualization. These are more appropriate for categorical data, or for types of continuous data where there are only a handful of distinct values.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = region)) + 
  geom_bar()
```


# Univariate Data Analysis

Univariate is pretty much what it sounds like: one variable. When undertaking univariate data analysis, we need first and foremost to figure what type of variable it is that we're working with. Once we do that, we can choose the appropriate use of the variable, either as an outcome or as a possible predictor.

## Motivating Question

We'll be working with data from every NBA player who was active during the 2018-19 season. 

Here's the data:

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
nba<-read_rds("https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC4175_SUM2025/raw/main/Data/nba_players_2018.Rds")
```

This data contains the following variables:

We're interested in the following questions:

-   Do certain colleges produce players that have more field goals? What about free throw percentage above a certain level? Are certain colleges in the east or the west more likely to produce higher scorers? How does this vary as a player has more seasons?

To answer these questions we need to look at the following variables:

-   Field goals
-   Free throw percentage above .25
-   Colleges
-   Player seasons
-   Region

We're going to go through a pretty standard set of steps for each variable. First, examine some cases. Second, based on our examination, we'll try either a plot or a table. Once we've seen the plot or the table, we'll think a bit about ordering, and then choose an appropriate measure of central tendency, and maybe variation.

## Types of Variables

It's really important to understand the types of variables you're working with. Many times analysts are indifferent to this step particularly with larger datasets. This can lead to a great deal of confusion down the road.  Below are the variable types we'll be working with this semester and the definition of each. 

### Continuous Variables

A continuous variable can theoretically be subdivided at any arbitrarily small measure and can still be identified. You may have encountered further subdivision of continuous variables into "interval" or "ratio" data in other classes. We RARELY use these distinctions in practice. The distinction between a continuous and a categorical variable is hugely consequential, but the distinction between interval and ratio is not really all that important in practice.

The mean is the most widely used measure of central tendency for a continuous variable. If the distribution of the variable isn't very symmetric or there are large outliers, then the median is a much better measure of central tendency. 

### Categorical Variables

A categorical variables divides the sample up into a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories. Mutually exclusive means that each case can only be one, and exhaustive means that the categories cover every possible option. Categorical is sort of the "top" level classification for variables of this type. Within the broad classification of categorical there are multiple types of other variables.


#### Categorical: ordered 

an ordered categorical variable has-- you guessed it-- some kind of sensible order that can be applied. For instance, the educational attainment of an individual: high school diploma, associates degree, bachelor's degree, graduate degree-- is an ordered categorical variable.

Ordered categorical variables should be arranged in the order of the variable, with proportions or percentages associated with each order. The mode, or the category with the highest proportion, is a reasonable measure of central tendency, but with fewer than ten categories the analyst should generally just show the proportion in each category. 

##### Categorical: ordered, binary

An ordered binary variable has just two levels, but can be ordered. For instance, is a bird undertaking its first migration: yes or no? A "no" means that the bird has more than one.

The mean of a binary variable is exactly the same thing as the proportion of the sample with that characteristic. So, the mean of a binary variable for "first migration" where 1="yes" will give the proportion of birds migrating for the first time. 

An ordered binary variable coded as 0  or 1 can be summarized using the mean which is the same thing as the proportion of the sample with that characteristic.

#### Categorical: unordered

An unordered categorical variable has no sensible ordering that can be applied. Think about something like college major. There's no "number" we might apply to philosophy that has any meaningful distance from a number we might apply to chemical engineering.

Unlike an ordered variable, an unordered categorical variable should be ordered in terms of the proportions falling into each of the categories. As with an unordered variable, it's best just to show the proportions in each category for variables with less than ten levels. The mode is a reasonable single variable summary of an unordered categorical variable. 

##### Categorical: unordered, binary

This kind of variable has no particular order, but can be just binary. A "1" means that the case has that characteristics, a "0" means the case does not have that characteristic. For instance, whether a tree is deciduous or not.

An unordered binary variable  coded as 0  or 1 can also be summarized by the mean, which is the same thing as the proportion of the sample with that characteristic. 

### Formats for categorical variables

In R, categorical variables CAN be stored as text, numbers or even logicals. Don't count on the data to help you out-- you as the analyst need to figure this out.

## Factors

We probably need to talk about factors. <SIGH> In R, a factor is a way of storing categorical variables. The factor provides additional information, including an ordering of the variable and a number assigned to each "level" of the factor. A categorical variable is a general term that's understood across statistics. A factor variable is a specific R term. Most of the time it's best not to have a categorical variable structured as a factor unless you know you want it to be a factor. More on this later . . .

## The Process: #TrustTheProcess

I'm going to walk you through how an analyst might typically decide what type of variables they're working with. It generally works like this:

1. Take a look at a few observations and form a guess as to what type of variable it is.
2. Based on that guess, create an appropriate plot or table. 
3. If the plot or table looks as expected, calculate some summary measures. If not, go back to 1. 

## "Glimpse" to start: what's in here anyway?

The first thing we're going to do with any dataset is just to take a quick look. We can call the data itself, but that will just show the first few cases and the first few variables. Far better is the glimpse command, which shows us all variables and the first few observations for all of the variables. Here's a link to the codebook for this dataset:

The six variables we're going to think about are field goals, free throw percentage, seasons played,  rookie season, college attended, and conference played in. 

```{r}
glimpse(nba)
```

## Continuous

Let's start by taking a look at field goals. It seems pretty likely that this is a continuous variable. Let's take a look at the top 50 spots. 

```{r}
nba%>% ## Start with the dataset
  select(namePlayer,slugTeam,fgm)%>% ## and then select a few variables
  arrange(-fgm)%>% ## arrange in reverse order of field goals
  print(n=50) ## print out the top 50
```

So what I'm seeing here is that field goals aren't "clumped" at certain levels. Let's confirm that by looking at a kernel density plot. 

```{r}
nba%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=fgm))+
  geom_density()
```

We can also use a histogram to figure out much the same thing. 
```{r}
nba%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=fgm))+
  geom_histogram()
```

Now, technically field goals don't meet the definition I set out above as being a continuous variable because they aren't divisible below a certain amount. Usually in practice though we just ignore this-- this variable is "as good as" continuous, given that it varies smoothly over the range and isn't confined to a relatively small set of possible values. 

**Quick Exercise**: Do the same thing for field goal percentage and think about what kind of variable it is.

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```


## Measures for Continuous Variables

The mean is used most of the time for continuous variables, but it's VERY sensitive to outliers. The median (50th percentile) is usually better, but it can be difficult to explain to general audiences. 

```{r}
nba%>%
  summarize(mean_fgm=mean(fgm))

nba%>%
  summarize(median_fgm=median(fgm))
```

In this case I'd really prefer the mean as a single measure of field goal production, but depending on the audience I still might just go ahead and use the median. 

**Quick Exercise** What measure would you prefer for field goal percentage? Calculate that measure.

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
``` 

## Categorical: ordered

Let's take a look at player seasons. 

```{r}
nba%>%
  select(namePlayer,numberPlayerSeason)%>%
  arrange(-numberPlayerSeason)%>%
  print(n=50)
```

Looks like it might be continuous? Let's plot it:

```{r}
nba%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=numberPlayerSeason))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Nope. See how it falls into a small set of possible categories? This is an ordered categorical variable. That means we should calculate the proportions in each category

```{r}
nba%>%
  group_by(numberPlayerSeason)%>%
  count(name="total_in_group")%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  mutate(proportion=total_in_group/sum(total_in_group))
```

What does this tell us? 

**Quick Exercise** Create a histogram for player age. What does that tell us about the NBA?

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```

## Categorical: ordered, binary

Let's take a look at the variable for Rookie season. 

```{r}
nba%>%select(namePlayer,isRookie)
```

Okay, so that's set to a logical. In R, TRUE or FALSE are special values that indicate the result of a logical question. In this it's whether or not the player is a rookie. 

Usually we want a binary variable to have at least one version that's structured so that 1= TRUE and 2=FALSE. This makes data analysis much easier.  Let's do that with this variable. 

This code uses `ifelse` to create a new variable called `isRookiebin` that's set to 1 if the `isRookie` variable is true, and 0 otherwise.  

```{r}
nba<-nba%>%
  mutate(isRookie_bin=ifelse(isRookie==TRUE,1,0))
```

Now that it's coded 0,1 we can calculate the mean, which is the same thing as the proportion of the players that are rookies. 

```{r}
nba%>%summarize(mean=mean(isRookie_bin))
```

## Categorical: unordered

Let's take a look at which college a player attended, which is a good example of an unordered categorical variable.  The `org` variable tells us which organization the player was in before playing in the NBA. 

```{r}
nba%>%
  select(org)%>%
  glimpse()
```

This look like team or college names, so this would be a categorical variable.  Let's take a look at the counts of players from different organizations:

```{r}
nba%>%
  group_by(org)%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(-n)%>%
  print(n=50)
```

Here we have a problem. If we're interested just in colleges, we're going to need to structure this a bit more. The code below filters out three categories that we don't want: missing data, anything classified as others, and sports teams from other countries. The last is incomplete-- I probably missed some! If I were doing this for real, I would use a list of colleges and only include those names.  

What I do below is to negate the `str_detect` variable by placing the `!` in front of it. This means I want all of the cases that don't match the pattern the supplied. The pattern makes heavy use of the OR operator `|`. I'm saying I don't want to include players whose organization included the letters `CB` r `KK` and so on (these are common prefixes for sports organizations in other countries, I definitely did not look that up on Wikipedia. Ok, I did.).

```{r}
nba%>%
  filter(!is.na(org))%>%
  filter(!org=="Other")%>%
  filter(!str_detect(org,"CB|KK|rytas|FC|B.C.|S.K.|Madrid"))%>%
  group_by(org)%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(-n)%>%
  print(n=50)
```

That looks better. Which are the most common colleges and universities that send players to the NBA?

**Quick Exercise** Arrange the number of players by team in descending order.

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```

## Categorical: unordered, binary

There are two conference in the NBA, eastern and western. Let's take a look at the variable that indicates which conference the payer played in that season. 

```{r}
nba%>%select(idConference)%>%
  glimpse()
```

It looks like conference is structured as numeric, but a "1" or a "2". Because it's best to have binary variables structured as "has the characteristic" or "doesn't have the characteristic" we're going to create a variable for western conference that's set  to 1 if the player was playing in the western conference and 0 if the player was not (this is the same as playing in the eastern conference).

```{r}
nba<-nba%>%
  mutate(west_conference=ifelse(idConference==1,1,0))
```

Once we've done that, we can see how many players played in each conference. 

```{r}
nba%>%
  summarize(mean(west_conference))
```

Makes sense!

**Quick Exercise**:* create a variable for whether or not the player is from the USA. Calculate the proportion of players from the USA in the NBA. The coding on country is ... decidedy US-centric, so you'll need to think about this one a bit.

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE
```

## Analysis

Ok, now that we know how this works, we can do some summary analysis. First of all, what does the total number of field goals made look like by college? 

We know that field goals are continuous (sort of) so let's summarize them via the mean. We know that college is a categorical variable, so we'll use that to group the data. This is one of our first examples of a conditiona mean, which we'll use a lot. 


## Top 50 Colleges by Total FG
```{r}
nba%>%
  filter(!is.na(org))%>%
  filter(!org=="Other")%>%
  filter(!str_detect(org,"CB|KK|rytas|FC|B.C.|S.K.|Madrid"))%>%
  group_by(org)%>%
  summarize(mean_fg=sum(fgm))%>%
  arrange(-mean_fg)%>%
  print(n=50)

```

Next, what about field goal percentage? 

## Top 50 Colleges by Average Field Goal Percent
```{r}
nba%>%
  filter(!is.na(org))%>%
  filter(!org=="Other")%>%
  filter(!str_detect(org,"CB|KK|rytas|FC|B.C.|S.K.|Madrid"))%>%
  group_by(org)%>%
  summarize(mean_ftp=mean(pctFT))%>%
  arrange(-mean_ftp)%>%
  print(n=50)
```

**Quick Exercise** Calculate free throw percent made by player season.
